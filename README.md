The Pomodoro Timer App is an iOS productivity tool built using Swift and UIKit. It helps users manage their time effectively with three timer modes: Focus (15 mins), Short Break (3 mins), and Long Break (9 mins). The app features a live countdown, a progress bar that tracks elapsed time, and a "Time's Up" message when the timer finishes. Users can switch between modes easily, and the app resets the timer and progress bar dynamically. Itâ€™s a simple yet effective way to practice time management and boost productivity.
